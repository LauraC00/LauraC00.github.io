                    <p>5/6 scenarios start with the user on the homepage and establishing their account status before
                        being taken to the "Browse Festivals page". I did
                        this because in order to submit to FilmFreeway/handle your projects you need an account and I
                        decided to not go with the prefix that the user is already logged in, or that they start the
                        login/sign up process at a later stage in the scenario.</p>
                        <p> Bigger versions of the flow charts

                        account.</p>

                    <p>The user starts on the FF Homepage and either logs in or signs up which we can

                        ths scenario the users presses the submit now button for the festvial they wish to submit to but
                        the user has no projects set up in their FilmFreeway account. As such a pop up asks them to add
                        a project, which is another decision diamond in the chart. If they select no, the user is
                        returned to the "Browse Festivals" page, if they select yes they then go through the process of
                        adding a project.</p>
                    <p>
                        They must upload their project info and their video file. Then the user can return to the
                        "Browse Festivals" page where they can now submit a film. To do this the user starts again by
                        pressing the submit button, they then choose a category in this festival and add their choice to
                        the cart/checkout. After this they must input their card details to then pay/complete their
                        order.
