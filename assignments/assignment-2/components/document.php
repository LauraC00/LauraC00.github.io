<h3> Step 1: </h3>
<p>In order to submit a film on FilmFreeway a user must first create an account. From the homepage the user can select “sign up” and a dialogue overlay is displayed giving them sign up options. This dialogue overlay has a light box effect, dimming the information behind the overlay. In our example the user selects to sign up with their email, which prompts the dialogue overlay to ask for the user’s information and includes two optional radio buttons. </p>

<h3> Step 3: </h3>
<p>After the user inputs their information and clicks the save button, they are brought to a new page where they can upload their film. They can either upload a file or link, but in our example the user opts for the file upload. The user clicks the choose file button which opens the file explorer on their computer. The user can choose to drag and drop their film file into the upload section or can select it directly via the file explorer. When the user hits save a progress bar shows the percentages of the film upload. Once it is fully uploaded the user can play their film, select a still frame among other optional things.  </p>

<div class="col-sm-7 ms-5 ps-5">
<h3> Step 4: </h3>
<p>From here the user is taken to the “my projects” page and where they can choose to browse festivals. The browse festivals page includes a live preview search bar and filters that use both radio buttons and checkboxes. The lower end of these filters also makes use of a list inlay in the form of an accordion e.g., the festival focus section, region/country section etc. There is a drop-down sort by menu the user can also avail of. There are two rows of festival images that include a hover real tool which shows a view festival button.  </p>

<h3> Step 5: </h3>
<p>The user can submit to a festival directly on this page by clicking the “submit now” button. This button will bring up a dialogue overlay, again with a lightbox effect. This overlay asks the user to select from a drop-down menu the film they wish to submit and to select the corresponding checkbox for the category and fee they wish to submit to. Once everything is selected our user example adds it to their cart and goes to checkout. </p>

<center><img src="components/Cart.png" style="width: 450px" /></center>
</div>
<div class="col-sm-7 ms-5 ps-5">
<h3> Step 6: </h3>
<p>The checkout page shows a summary of the user’s order, has an “add cover letter” button, a section for the user to add their card details, that includes checkboxes, and finally a payment summary. Once the user is happy with everything, they can then finalize their submission by clicking the “pay and complete order” button.  </p>
</div>

<div class="row mt-5 mx-5 py-4 alt">
<div class="col-sm-7">
<h3> Step 7: </h3>
<p>After this button is pressed, the user is taken to a confirmation page. They are thanked for their submission, told that a receipt is being sent to their email, and below their order summary are given an option to directly download the receipt. Also included is a “continue browsing festivals” button to encourage the user to submit to another festival.  </p>
