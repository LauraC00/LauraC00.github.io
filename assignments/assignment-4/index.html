                    <p>For this assignment I decided to design a mobile application, specifically, I created a gym
                        membership-based application. The main users for this application would be the gym members;
                        certain information gathered from this mobile application would be accessible by the gym
                        staff/admin through their associated website e.g., member names, email, etc. </p>

                        browser-based application, and one would be created to go hand in hand with the mobile

                        facility), to record the duration spent there if they chose to scan out when they leave, the
                        ability to make in-app notes about their work out, to get achievements, access club info, to

                    <p>The main colours used in my app design are blue, as I found it to be a popular colour associated
                        with other fitness-related apps, and orange as it is blue’s complementary colour. Buttons that
                        feature the orange accent progress the user through the system, while grey buttons send the user
                        back through the application. In my design, I stuck with commonly used symbols to keep things
                        simple for the user e.g., a bell icon for notifications, arrows to progress through the
                        application, a house icon for the home screen, a play button for videos, ‘i’ icon for
                        information etc. I used the same font in my design to keep a consistent feel to the application.
                    </p>
                    <p>Scrolling would be implemented where necessary e.g., on the demo categories page, as opposed to
                        pagination. Also, to save the user from scrolling endlessly and to increase usability, a search
                        bar is featured in the demos section to help them quickly find the exercise they are looking for
                        to avoid wasting time in the gym. </p>
                    <p>I ordered the home screen buttons by the category I thought would be used most often, first being
                        the QR code to regularly check into the gym, next being the demo videos, third the gym schedule,
                        and lastly the club info. I refined the ‘me’ section to the last icon in the tab bar as this is
                        where it is typically found in other mobile applications. </p>
                    <p>
                        I included some achievements the members can work towards. Adding a game element to the app, or
                        gamification, can make an activity seem more interesting and may encourage interaction (Oxford
                        Dictionary)

                    <p>As well as my own UX design, I will also look at a mobile application called Virtuagym and JEFIT.
                        Unfortunately, since my design is centered around being a member of a gym I am limited when it
                        comes to looking at similar apps i.e. I can’t access other gym-based applications as I am not a
                        member. Luckily I am a member of one gym and thus can use Virtuagym in my comparison, for the
                        second real life example required I found an application that offers exercise demos but isn’t
                        tied to a gym as it is a trait shared with my UX design. Due to these discrepancies, as well as
                        the fact I have built upon my app so it is not identical to ones I’m aware of/offers more
                        interactions, I can’t give four of the exact same activities that can be performed.

            <div class="row mx-5 py-2 mb-5 reveal">
                <div class="col-sm-12 px-5">
                    <p>A design principle I followed for signing up includes emails being used as usernames. Although in
                        my
                        sign-up section the user is asked for their name, this is only for display purposes in the app
                        and
                        would be displayed alongside the unique identifier i.e., their email address. I did this because
                        “email addresses are always unique and are easier to remember even” (Vora, Pawan 51). Another I
                        followed is grouping information, although not much information is required to sign up I still
                        grouped information according to their functions: the sign-up details, and the personal details
                        e.g., password, and date of birth (Vora, Pawan 22). I made use of embedded labels due to the
                        fact I
                        only have a few input fields (Vora, Pawan 26) I did forget to add “required field indications”
                        in my
                        prototype, but they would be added to all the fields in the initial sign up page. Error messages
                        would also be included if the user were to enter incorrect information. </p>

                    <p>I decided not to include the typical captcha seen in other applications due to the fact when
                        signing
                        up the user must enter a gym code, this is something they would have received into their email
                        after
                        paying to become a member, and it is individual to thus this isn’t going to be something an
                        automated agent couldn’t correctly fill in. Also, the email entered must be the one that is
                        already
                        associated with their gym membership after payment, something an an automated agent also cannot
                        fake. </p>
                    <p>I made use of single-field inline editing for the notes section of my application, this is where
                        the
                        user can make notes about a workout they had on a particular day and review it later if
                        necessary.
                        Using single-field inline editing allows the user to stay on the same screen and view the other
                        details above the notes section, which may aid them in what they decide to write (Scott, Bill
                        and
                        Neil Theresa 4). </p>

                    <p>I used two types of overlays in my app, a dialog overlay which is used to show the calendar in
                        the
                        schedule section of my application, and a detail overlay which is used to display information
                        about
                        check-ins in the ‘me’ section of my application; both of which make use of the lightbox effect
                        i.e.,
                        dimming down the background behind the overlay (Scott, Bill and Neil Theresa 107-118). Although
                        not
                        shown, the filter option in the schedule section of my application would make use of check boxes
                        that the user can use to select which class they which to filter by.</p>

                    <p>Where required the majority of my application uses virtual scrolling to navigate, e.g., scrolling
                        through the demo categories list. But for signing up, I opted for pagination; this was done to
                        section off certain elements of information i.e., account information, and personal information,
                        and
                        to not overwhelm the user by seeing a vast number of required inputs on one screen (Scott, Bill
                        and
                        Neil Theresa 137). </p>

                    <p>The search bars featured in the demos section would make use of the auto complete pattern i.e.,
                        As
                        the user types input into a field, a drop-down menu of matching values is displayed (Scott, Bill
                        and
                        Neil Theresa 253). I did this because searching is easier and more efficient than navigating the
                        application (Vora, Pawan 144) </p>
