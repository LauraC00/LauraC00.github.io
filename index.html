                        Bachelors in Law and IT, and have background in various different types of art, though my work

                        been
                        printed onto his merch. Art areas I would be particular interested in include graphic deisgn
                        e.g., logo design, photo
                        editing, and digital drawing.<br>Through my Masters I have advanced my coding skills that were
                        developed during my undergrad, I have gained new skills in video editing, p5.js coding, expanded
                        my outlook on digital media, and increased my creative ability.</p>

                <div class="col-sm-8">
                    <p class="text-left">My first big coding project for my Master's was creating a fake film festival
                        website using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. We were required to include Bootstrap features such as a
                        navigation menu, dropdown, accordion, modal, form (using Formspree, including relevant error
                        messages), 4 different text types, buttons, and that our links should open in a new tape. As a
                        bonus we could opt to include a full screening schedule, which I did, and I also decided to
                        incorporate Javascript. </p>
                    <p> Each film category had to include at least 6 films with the following details: title, director,
                        poster image, genre, release year, country, trailer. We needed a contact/submission form for
                        your festival, a sponsorssection and links to 3 social media accounts with the relevant logos.
                    </p>
                    <p>I had the screen time button link to the screening schedule, and
                        used Javascript to highlight the relevant time; I did this to make it more obvious to the user
                        which movie in the list they were looking for, as it had the potential to get confusing, but the
                        use of the green highlight instantly draws their eye to the movie screening time they wanted to
                        see.</p>

            <div class="row mx-5">
                <div class="col-sm-12">
                    <p>The theme I chose for the festival was screening classic, obsecure, and submission movies which
                        helped me come up with the name CONS film festival. I also designed a logo for the festival, the
                        logo was based on the four aspects of the CONS Film Festival: Classic, Obscure, New, and
                        Submissions.The classic aspect is represented by using Ireland's classic colour, green. The
                        obscure aspect is represented by the logo's design itself. The new aspect is represented by the
                        spiral and loop part of the logo which is taken from the top half of the celtic symbol for new
                        beginnings. And lastly,the submissions aspect is represented in the lower half of the logo with
                        two abstract arrows.</p>

                    <p>Knowing I wanted green as my main colour as it represented the classic theme of the festival, I
                        used it's complimentary colour alongside it which happened to be the pink you see on the
                        website. With two strong colours accented around the website I chose to keep the other colours
                        neutral as to keep it from being too overwhelming.</p>

                            application design project. We had to design an application that offers different
                            interaction
                            types to its users. I decided to go with a mobile application, and mentioned that it would
                            in
                            theory have a sister browswer-based application.</p>
                        <p>The website which we had to create for this projected needed to include documentation, e.g.
                            stating the functionality of our project, the user experiences offered, the data types etc.
                            As
                            well as this we needed to provide user scenarios, simple flow diagrams, a user flow map that
                            e.g. a wireframe user flow or workflow diagram, to create a prototype for our product, and
                            to
                            document our design principles.</p>
                        <p>The website I used to host this information was made as a single page website using
                            Javascript, and I incorporated my own Javascript reveal code so that elements fade in and
                            out on scroll. The layout of the website was then made with simple rows and cols. </p>

                        <p>The mobile application I designed was called Form Fitness, it was a mobile application for
                            gym
                            members. The main application would be to scan into the gym upon arrival. It included other
                            important features such as logging your gym arrival and depature dates and times, as well as
                            duration, hosting a plethora pre-recorded exercise videos all in one place, showing the
                            gym's
                            opening hours and contact information in the app and so the user doesn't need to search
                            online
                            for this information and lastly offering a system for members to join gym classes directly

                        </p>
                        <p>I created a simple logo for this app which played on the name "Form Fitness". I took both
                            F's,
                            coloured them the main and secondary colours of the app, and flipping the last one to make
                            somewhat of a simply geometric shape. The main colour I went with was blue as it seemed a
                            popular colour among other fitness related apps, and the secondary colour used was orange,
                            the
                            complimentary colour to the blue. </p>
