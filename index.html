                        Bachelors in Law and IT, and have background in various different types of art, though my work

                        emotes

                        been
                        printed onto his merch. Art areas I would be particular interested in include graphic deisgn
                        e.g., logo design, photo
                        editing, and digital drawing.<br>Through my Masters I have advanced my coding skills that were
                        developed during my undergrad, I have gained new skills in video editing, p5.js coding, expanded
                        my outlook on digital media, and increased my creative ability.</p>

                    <p class="text-left">My first big coding project for my Master's was creating a fake film festival
                        website using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. We were required to include Bootstrap features such as a
                        navigation menu, dropdown, accordion, modal, form (using Formspree, including relevant error
                        messages), 4 different text types, buttons, and that our links should open in a new tape. As a
                        bonus we could opt to include a full screening schedule, which I did, and I also decided to
                        incorporate Javascript. </p>
                    <p> Each film category had to include at least 6 films with the following details: title, director,
                        poster image, genre, release year, country, trailer. We needed a contact/submission form for
                        your festival, a sponsorssection and links to 3 social media accounts with the relevant logos.
                    </p>
                    <p>I had the screen time button link to the screening schedule, and
                        used Javascript to highlight the relevant time; I did this to make it more obvious to the user
                        which movie in the list they were looking for, as it had the potential to get confusing, but the
                        use of the green highlight instantly draws their eye to the movie screening time they wanted to
                        see.</p>

                <div class="col-sm-12">
                    <p>The theme I chose for the festival was screening classic, obsecure, and submission movies which
                        helped me come up with the name CONS film festival. I also designed a logo for the festival, the
                        logo was based on the four aspects of the CONS Film Festival: Classic, Obscure, New, and
                        Submissions.The classic aspect is represented by using Ireland's classic colour, green. The
                        obscure aspect is represented by the logo's design itself. The new aspect is represented by the
                        spiral and loop part of the logo which is taken from the top half of the celtic symbol for new
                        beginnings. And lastly,the submissions aspect is represented in the lower half of the logo with
                        two abstract arrows.</p>

                    <p>Knowing I wanted green as my main colour as it represented the classic theme of the festival, I
                        used it's complimentary colour alongside it which happened to be the pink you see on the
                        website. With two strong colours accented around the website I chose to keep the other colours
                        neutral as to keep it from being too overwhelming.</p>

                            application design project. We had to design an application that offers different
                            interaction
                            types to its users. I decided to go with a mobile application, and mentioned that it would
                            in
                            theory have a sister browswer-based application.</p>
                        <p>The website which we had to create for this projected needed to include documentation, e.g.
                            stating the functionality of our project, the user experiences offered, the data types etc.
                            As
                            well as this we needed to provide user scenarios, simple flow diagrams, a user flow map that
                            e.g. a wireframe user flow or workflow diagram, to create a prototype for our product, and
                            to
                            document our design principles.</p>

                            Javascript, and I incorporated my own Javascript reveal code so that elements fade in and
                            out on scroll. The layout of the website was then made with simple rows and cols. </p>

                        <p>The mobile application I designed was called Form Fitness, it was a mobile application for
                            gym
                            members. The main application would be to scan into the gym upon arrival. It included other
                            important features such as logging your gym arrival and depature dates and times, as well as
                            duration, hosting a plethora pre-recorded exercise videos all in one place, showing the
                            gym's
                            opening hours and contact information in the app and so the user doesn't need to search
                            online
                            for this information and lastly offering a system for members to join gym classes directly
                            through the app.
                        </p>
                        <p>I created a simple logo for this app which played on the name "Form Fitness". I took both
                            F's,
                            coloured them the main and secondary colours of the app, and flipping the last one to make
                            somewhat of a simply geometric shape. The main colour I went with was blue as it seemed a
                            popular colour among other fitness related apps, and the secondary colour used was orange,
                            the
                            complimentary colour to the blue.

                    <p class="text-left">This next project was developed in my Generative Media module in which we
                        worked with p5.js.
                        For tihs project we were creating a creative generative media project that was critical and
                        technical;demonstrating the practice of working with and thinking with computational procedures.
                        In addition to engaging with computer code using exploratory methods, the project also explored
                        the ways that computation impacts experiences and realities; not just creating a generative
                        project, but drawing attention to how computation influences us. </p>
                    <p>The main function of my for this project software was to enforce periodical and timed breaks for
                        a user, from their computer screen. To carry this out I created a game the user can interact
                        with called “Catch the Apple”, upon which my main software would then be able to run. To win the
                        game the user must collect 45 apples and if they miss 10 apples they lose. The game works by
                        drawing an apple vertically just out of view of top of the screen from which it will begin to
                        fall, and after one iteration its horizontal position is randomized.</p>

                <div class="col-sm-12">
                    <p>In order to enforce the screen break software, my code uses frameCount(). It’s important to note
                        that for the purposes of the project, I have every second acting as what would be a minute of
                        real-time, so 1 minute is one hour, and 5 seconds is 5 minutes. So once the frame count reaches
                        3600 (1 minute), the gameplay is paused, preserving the user’s activity, and a black screen is
                        displayed.</p>

                    <p>This code sets out to explore the need and benefits of taking a break from your computer screen,
                        something many people don’t do regularly or of their own accord. Although the software can’t
                        physically force a user to get up from their seat — assuming they have been sitting — and start
                        stretching, it still gives their eyes a break from the computer screen. Future work on this
                        software could allow for exemptions to be made, in the case of an approaching deadline where you
                        haven’t yet completed the work, or not forcing the break if the user is in the middle of
                        uploading something. If used in an office setting the times could possibly be altered by the
                        boss, making the work period a maximum of 2 hours with a 5-minute break in between. </p>

                    <p>The first video project I did consistent of gathering a series of 4-3 minute shots and editing
                        them with different techniques. The requirements were to create 4 short observational shots of
                        domestic and outdoor
                        spaces of our choice which explore distinctions of the space, textures or histories to build an
                        image of our chosen environment /space. Below are 3 of my works from this project.

                    <h5 class="fs-3 mt-4">Gaillimh</h5>
                    <p>As Galway is a rather old city with old architecture, I decided to use this as inspiration for my
                        editing. An architectural photographer I like is Keith Dotson. His photos are greyscale but
                        since I’m working with video I decided to colour my clips sepia to mimic the old film style.
                        Using fractal noise I created dust-like spots and strings that were animated and added in a bit
                        of “glitching” by moving the film’s position. Using the offset effect gave that film roll style
                        at the beginning and end of the video. Between clips I chose not to use any transition because I
                        thought the harshness added to the style. </p>

                    <p>I picked one of the Adobe looks that I felt created nice colouring to add over my footage and
                        used a cross dissolve to depict different points of my journey. I feel this transition type
                        helps give the feeling of the passage of time. One disadvantage of using the bus’s movement was
                        its inconsistent speed, so I needed to increase and decrease my film speed in areas to make it
                        look more cohesive. </p>

                    <p>I took a few different shots of the river as I moved down towards the ducks. I found myself using
                        an analogous colour scheme with highly saturated blues and greens which creates a sense of calm.
                        I feel this colour method draws the eyes to the organic elements of the shots and away from the
                        few man made structures. I was somewhat inspired by Isaac Levitan, who paints a lot of
                        landscapes, and in his painting “Spring in Italy” he uses a lot of saturation. I tried to do a
                        panning shot following the ducks along the water but due to my filming process being all
                        handheld, the footage was shaky, so I decided to edit it with a transition and used this
                        transition between all my clips.</p>

                            where we
                            consider production and scene design, lighting and formal aspects of composition.
                            Key to this project was investigation into motion graphics, animation, multi channel and
                            composites lighting, framing the use of computer-generated imagery, props devices and
                            backgrounds.
                            The aim of this project to build visually exciting and engaging piece that can occupy a
                            number of different contexts, for example projections for live performance or animations
                            that function as moving paintings or sculptures. Most importantly we needed to be able to
                            tell a story in one scene.</p>

                        <p>I was inspired by William Kentridge’s charcoal animation style, so when drawing my frames
                            digitally I decided to use a charcoal brush. Because of this I also opted to do my piece
                            mainly in black and white. Using just a bit of colour made it easy to show when lights were
                            turned on or off in the house and helps to guide the viewer's eye in the scene. I created
                            some atmosphere with the wind and later use of rain sounds, and used the crying baby sound
                            to help convey my story. I was also inspired by Ben Hibon, specifically in my design of the
                            skeletal creature. </p>

                        Islandora
                        Repository Oral History Collection’s Tuam Oral History Project as a means to explore how moving
                        image projects can engage society and collective memory.The key aim of the Tuam Oral History
                        Project is to enable the survivors of the Tuam institution and their families to tell their own
                        life stories, in the way that they want them to be told. In that regard, members of the project
                        team will record and archive the histories and life stories of survivors and their families, as
                        well as the memories of others connected in any way with the institution or with those who spent
                        time there. <br> The aim of this assignment was to get us
                        to engage with various editing moving image techniques employed by artists included working with
                        still images, found footage voice overs and text as a means to create our own response.

                    <p>One of the survivors I found myself drawn to in the archive was Peter Mulryan, specifically the
                        documentation he has in his archive i.e., the names of the babiein the home, the number of
                        deatsh each year, and the cause of death. I knew I wanted to work with these in some way so I
                        found a liste containing the names of the 796 babies that passed in the home. I also found a
                        site that used the phrasing "The forgetting Angels of Tuam", and this gave me the idea for my
                        video. I decided to light a candle in remeberance of the lost babies, and around the candle I
                        placed little angel statues that were gotten for me from Lourdes. This idea was also inspired by
                        the grave in tuam that has the Virgin Mary statue. I placed some little rocks that I have aorund
                        the angles in my video, referencing the stone wall at which the Virgin Mary stands in the Tuam
                        grave. </p>
                    <p>In Premiere I made 36 copies of the original video, one video for one baby that died every year
                        in the 36 years that the home was open. I did a voice over of myself saying the year, the name
                        of one of tha babies that died that year, and the age at which they passed. This idea was
                        sinprised by a work called A Sort of Joy (Thousands of Exhausted Things), that showed how
                        impactful hearing data can be as opposed to reading it.<br> Music from BenSound

                            only ask was that video or audio submissions don't exceed 10 minutes. I decided to do a
                            short film style of project using screen recording software.</p>
                        <h5 class="fs-3 mt-4">Breach</h5>
                        <p>In the movie we first follow Alice, 14, a girl who made a friend, “Jake”, through online
                            gaming. They chat over Discord before Alice is unknowingly manipulated into giving “Jake”
                            her Snapchat, where the two exchange selfies. Later they decide to meet up, but Alice has
                            lied to her mom about who she is going to meet. Alice is going to be picked up by “Jake’s”
                            dad from school and then they will go to collect “Jake”. </p>

                        <p>In reality, a predator is behind the “Jake” persona, lying about his age and reaching out
                            through gaming to meet young girls. He established trust and a relationship with the victim,
                            tactics previously mentioned by Wolak. This allows him to arrange a meeting with Alice and
                            tell her his “dad” is picking her up, but it will be the predator himself. This façade will
                            have her get into his car without coercion, fight or suspicion about there not being a boy
                            her age also in the car, since she believes, they are going to pick “Jake” up. </p>

                        <p>Next, we follow Conor, 15. Unlike Alice’s situation where she is being deceived, his danger
                            is clear. He is experiencing cyberbullying and threats of in-person bullying. We watch as
                            the cyberbully targets and threatens him, but Conor is too scared to say anything. Then, we
                            watch as he searches about being bullied online, depression due to bullying, and finally
                            suicide, two of the potential risks associated with cyberbullying.</p>

                    <p>For the final project in my degree I decided to run a media campaign to increase awareness about
                        image manipulation in the media and try to re-establish the fundamentals of the body positive
                        movement to focus on health and not appearance to combat unrealistic photo manipulation in the
                        media. I aimed to show the effect doctored images can have on the public, how easily an image
                        can be altered without you knowing, show how these images can affect people’s body image
                        perception, and try to promote non-edited images.
                    </p>
                    <h5 class="fs-3 mt-4">#Shareflaws</h5>
                    <p>As part of this project I created a time lapse video of me editing an image to show how easily it
                        can be done by a non professional. I also added a voice over to the video, for which I took
                        inspiration from a poem called "The Perfect Body?" by StevieC Poet, specifically the first third
                        of the poem. "Too fat ....Too thin. Too ugly .... too plain. Too spotty.... too pale. Too
                        broken.... too frail. Too many....too few. Too flawed ....too scored". I added on a few more
                        adjectives like this to the end and used this as the voice-over with layering. I thought this
                        was better in terms of using slick words, and as you'll hear as the speed/intensity increases in
                        the voiceover I began to drop the word "too" to get more slick and punchy.

                        awareness about image manipulation in the media etc, I created a series of edited vs unedited
                        images to prove how undetectable these alterations can be. I wanted to demonstrate how
                        believable and easy they manipulations can be done by someone who is self taught. Below are the
